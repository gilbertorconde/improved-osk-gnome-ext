This extension is a fork of [SebastianLuebke/improved-osk-gnome-ext](https://github.com/SebastianLuebke/improved-osk-gnome-ext).

## Installation

### From extensions.gnome.org

https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4413/improved-osk/

### From source code
Clone the repo, change into its root directory, run `package-extension.sh`,
install and enable the extension:

```console
git clone https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext.git
cd ./improved-osk-gnome-ext
./package-extension.sh
gnome-extensions install improvedosk@nick-shmyrev.dev.shell-extension.zip
gnome-extensions enable improvedosk@nick-shmyrev.dev
```

After enabling extension, log out and back in to reload Gnome Shell.

### As a system-wide extension
**This is an experimental feature**, see issue [#41](https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext/issues/41) for details and bug reports! 

Installing as a system-wide extension allows Improved OSK to be used on Gnome's login screen, as well as within the user session.

To install as a system-wide extension:

1. Remove the extension if you have it installed:
```console
gnome-extensions uninstall improvedosk@nick-shmyrev.dev
```

2. Clone this repo:
```console
git clone https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext.git
```

3. Add `"gdm"` to `session-modes` array in `metadata.json` file. The result should look something like this:
```json
{
  // rest of the metadata.json properties...
  "session-modes": ["gdm", "user", "unlock-dialog"]
}
```
4. Run `/package-extension.sh` script to package extension

5. Then follow this [guide](https://help.gnome.org/admin/system-admin-guide/stable/extensions-enable.html.en), or use the `install-as-global-extension.sh` script.

If extension is installed, but the keyboards doesn't show up on login screen, tap on accessibility options in upper right corner of the screen, and enable "Screen Keyboard".


## FAQ

### My language layout doesn't have the additional keys.
If the layout you're using does not have the extended keys, let me know, and I'll add them.
Or, feel free to modify it yourself (see [/src/data/osk-layouts](https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext/tree/master/src/data/osk-layouts) dir) and make a PR.

### How do I make a custom layout?
You'll need to follow the manual installation process from [README](https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext/blob/master/README.md#from-source-code),
but before running `package-extension.sh` you'll have to make changes to your preferred layout
(see [osk-layouts](https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext/tree/master/src/data/osk-layouts)), then continue with the installation process.

### I want to test this extension with a new version of Gnome.
To install the extension on an unsupported Gnome version, you can either add desired version number to `metadata.json` file and proceed with a manual installation,
or disable extension version check and then install from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4413/improved-osk/):

```console
gsettings set org.gnome.shell disable-extension-version-validation true
```

See [TEST_CASES](https://github.com/nick-shmyrev/improved-osk-gnome-ext/blob/master/TEST_CASES.md) for test cases.

### Do I need to enable the OSK in Gnome accessibility settings?
By default, the keyboard will pop up on touch input events.
You can use "Force touch-input" option in extension preferences
to force the OSK to appear on non-touch events.

### Extension is installed and activated, but keyboard layout doesn't change.
Gnome's default on-screen keyboard, on which this extension is based on,
uses `ibus` package, make sure you have it installed.

### Some symbols are missing...
The keyboard uses unicode characters, try installing `ttf-symbola` on archlinux (AUR)
or `ttf-ancient-fonts-symbola` on ubuntu/debian
